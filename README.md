![AOT_Icon32-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb2024a0-5143-409e-b39f-38f141ae8b78) 


This AutoHotkey script allows you to easily toggle "Always on Top" mode for the currently active window using a keyboard shortcut. When the mode is active, a small visual indicator is displayed in the top-left corner of the window.
Features

    Toggle "Always on Top": Quickly enable or disable the "Always on Top" status for the currently active window using the Ctrl + Space keyboard shortcut.
    Visual Indicator: A small, customizable indicator is displayed in the top-left corner of the active window when the mode is enabled.
    Single Window Control: Only one window can be kept "Always on Top" at a time. Activating a new window will automatically disable the mode on the previous one.
    Automatic Cleanup: The indicator is removed when the window is closed or the mode is disabled.

## Usage

    Activate "Always on Top": Press Ctrl + Space to enable or disable "Always on Top" for the currently active window.
    Visual Feedback: A small aqua-colored indicator with a "ðŸ”¼" symbol appears in the top-left corner of the window to show that the mode is active.
    Manage Multiple Windows: If you set another window to "Always on Top", the mode is automatically disabled for the previous window.
